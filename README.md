This repository originates from [ComPWA/compwa-org#129](https://github.com/ComPWA/compwa-org/pull/129). It formulates a symbolic amplitude model for the decay Λc → pπK that is aligned with [Dalitz-plot decomposition](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.101.034033) and computes

## Installation

It's recommended to develop this code base with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install the developer environment with Conda:

```shell
conda env create
conda activate polarization
```

Style checks are enforced with [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com). To activate for each commit, run:

```shell
pre-commit install
```
